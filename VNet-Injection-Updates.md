# PowerPlatform VNet Injection Script Updates

## Issue Identified
The script contained incorrect guidance suggesting that VNet injection could be configured manually through the Power Platform admin center UI. This is **incorrect** - there are no manual UI options for VNet injection.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Script Header Documentation
- Added important clarification that VNet injection is configured **entirely via PowerShell scripts**
- Added note that there is NO manual UI option in the Power Platform admin center
- Added example of the correct manual PowerShell command to use

### 2. Corrected Completion Messages (Line ~2415)
**Before:**
```
Option 2: Manual VNet Injection (Immediate)
1. Go to https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com
2. Navigate to Environments > [ENVIRONMENT_ID]
3. Go to Settings > Networking > VNet injection
4. Select enterprise policy: [POLICY_NAME]
```

**After:**
```
IMPORTANT: VNet injection configuration must be completed via PowerShell
There is no manual UI option in the Power Platform admin center for VNet injection.

To complete the VNet injection setup:
Run this command to apply the enterprise policy to your environment:
.\SubnetInjection\NewSubnetInjection.ps1 -environmentId 'ENV_ID' -policyArmId 'POLICY_ARM_ID'

After applying the policy, you can validate the configuration:
1. Go to https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com
2. Navigate to Environments > [ENVIRONMENT_ID]
3. Select 'History' in the command bar
4. Verify the enterprise policy link shows Status: Succeeded
```

### 3. Fixed Error Messages (Lines ~1792, ~2035)
**Before:**
```
Alternative: Use PowerPlatform Admin Center to manually apply VNet injection:
- Go to https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com
- Navigate to Environments > [ENVIRONMENT_ID]  
- Go to Settings > Networking > VNet injection
- Select enterprise policy: [POLICY_NAME]
```

**After:**
```
Alternative: Use the official PowerShell script to manually apply VNet injection:
.\SubnetInjection\NewSubnetInjection.ps1 -environmentId 'ENV_ID' -policyArmId 'POLICY_ARM_ID'
Note: There is no manual UI option in the Power Platform admin center for VNet injection.
```

### 4. Updated Cleanup Messages (Line ~2199)
**Before:**
```
You may need to manually remove VNet injection via PowerPlatform Admin Center
```

**After:**
```
You may need to manually remove VNet injection using PowerShell script:
.\SubnetInjection\RevertSubnetInjection.ps1 -environmentId 'ENVIRONMENT_ID' -policyArmId 'POLICY_ARM_ID'
```

## Validation Process
The validation section correctly points users to check the environment history in the Power Platform admin center, which is the only UI element that shows VNet injection status:

1. Go to https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com
2. Navigate to Environments > [ENVIRONMENT_ID]
3. Select 'History' in the command bar  
4. Verify the enterprise policy link shows Status: Succeeded

## Official Microsoft Documentation References
Based on the official Microsoft documentation:
- [VNet support overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/vnet-support-overview)
- [Set up Virtual Network support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/vnet-support-setup-configure)
- [Enterprise Policies PowerShell Scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/powershell/enterprisePolicies/README.md)

VNet injection is configured entirely through PowerShell scripts using the Microsoft.PowerPlatform enterprise policies. The process involves:

1. Creating Azure VNet and subnets with delegation to `Microsoft.PowerPlatform/enterprisePolicies`
2. Creating a subnet injection enterprise policy in Azure
3. Applying the policy to Power Platform environments using PowerShell scripts
4. Validating the configuration through the environment history in the admin center

## Impact
These corrections ensure users receive accurate guidance and don't waste time looking for non-existent UI options in the Power Platform admin center.
